## Hello there! 👋

I'm **Pigia**, an indie game developer based in Italy.

I am a lover of programming and game design, that is, the structure of every video game.

Currently, I’m diving deep into the **Godot Game Engine** and the **GDScript**. 
I often find myself creating small games for small game jams with the aim of having fun and learning more about game development.

My favorite tools are godot, asesprite, goxel, and milanote

For me, video games are not just a passion. They are a true art form.

Fun Facts:
* I’m a huge music lover, expecialy metal music
* My coding is powered by coke and coffee 
* **Hobbies:** manga, videogames, guitar and gdr
